We are also known as UW Debate for short.

We were established in idk when.

Waterloo is a destination of both the CUSID and high school circuit.

We are highly active on social media, so make sure to follow us on Instagram!

This iteration of our website was made in 2024 by Alex Zhu, Advait Sangle, and Nyx Kucharski.
