What is the University of Waterloo Debate Society (aka UW Debate)?
{{< /lead >}}

We are Waterloo’s competitive debating society, established in 2006!

We regularly compete in tournaments across Canada and the globe (we [traveled to Vietnam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqoJs9QQuik) for WUDC this year). As a member of CUSID (the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate), we also annually host a high school tournament (Waterloo HST) and university tournament (Seagram’s IV).

Besides this, we try to have a great time! We go to Subway to grab food after meetings every Wednesday, travel across Canada, and [upload vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/@uwdebate) documenting our tournament adventures. 

We host meetings at 6:30 p.m. every Wednesday in RCH 110.

Again, we’re a **super beginner-friendly club** -- just pop by a Wednesday meeting to judge, debate, or just spectate! If you want to debate/judge at a tournament, or help us organize a Waterloo tournament, just reach out and we’ll likely have a spot for you :)
