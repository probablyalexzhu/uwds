**Step 1:** Join our Discord server! Here, we post meeting announcements/sign-in forms, tournament bids and results, and everything else debate-related!

**Step 2:** Fill in the sign-in form: Every Wednesday, we post a sign-in form in the #meeting-info channel. Let us know if you want to debate/judge, and whether you have experience, and weâ€™ll assign you a role accordingly.

**Step 3:** Just show up! We try to create a completely pressure-free environment, so feel free to let loose and run silly arguments -- this is a safe space to suck at debate and slowly get better.

**Bonus:** Read [How to Get Involved](/resources/get-involved/) on our website!
