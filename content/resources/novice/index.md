How do I learn to debate?
{{< /lead >}}

Getting involved as a novice in the world of debate can often be
overwhelming -- what with the seemingly impossible skill gap and the
pretentious jargon. To help you along this process, weâ€™ve compiled a
list of some of the best resources to help you better get involved in
both our club and the world of debating at large.

## Formats
- **To learn about the formats we use in debate,** refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgvx7Z7dR9U) by the
  Vancouver Debate Academy about the British Parliamentary (BP) Format and this [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Br8SlcPMc9pEeWen4pSO1lybw9fNoiwr1SdXn0mJ9C0/edit?usp=sharing) by our very own Elaine Zhao on the Canadian Parliamentary (CP) format.  
- We typically debate BP in most large tournaments through the year, and
  CP in some tournaments in winter.

## Jargon
- **To demystify debate jargon,** refer to the [Debate Dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dqxJgjqslkc7Bo7OHEx-tJTcwhwJwShq/view?usp=sharing) by Nyx Kucharski! A must read for new debaters!
