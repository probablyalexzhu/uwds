Getting involved as a novice in the world of debate can often be overwhelming \u0026ndash; what with the seemingly impossible skill gap and the pretentious jargon. To help you along this process, we’ve compiled a list of some of the best resources to help you better get involved in both our club and the world of debating at large.\nFormats To learn about the formats we use in debate, refer to the video by the Vancouver Debate Academy about the British Parliamentary (BP) Format and this slideshow by our very own Elaine Zhao on the Canadian Parliamentary (CP) format. We typically debate BP in most large tournaments through the year, and CP in some tournaments in winter. Jargon To demystify debate jargon, refer to the Debate Dictionary by Nyx Kucharski! A must read for new debaters!

How can I get more involved? To learn more about our club, keep reading to learn about how our club functions \u0026ndash; everything from how we run our meetings to how you can start going to tournaments. Also take a look at our tournament results and social media to see what we’re up to.\nWeekly Meetings For the most updated information, please refer to our How to Join page.\nA weekly meeting typically starts with a quick debate lesson by our VP Training, followed by a debate round on a different motion each week! After the debate round, our judges give a call on who won the round, explanation for the call, as well as some feedback on how each team could improve for next time.\nTournaments Written by Advait Sangle The best way to get better at debate is to attend competitive tournaments! We find that a lot of novices (this was definitely me in my two terms debating) regularly attend meetings, but are hesitant to go to tournaments for a number of reasons. For me, I was unsure if I could compete at a university level, and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with the embarassment of ending the tournament bottom of the tabs.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve realised since is that there\u0026rsquo;s incredible value in just ripping off the band-aid. To begin with, you\u0026rsquo;re probably much better than you give yourself credit for and are NOT going to end up bottom of the tabs \u0026ndash; and you can always judge/panel at a couple of tournaments before diving in headfirst. But besides this, tournaments are an actual blast \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;re the best way to meet (the very lovely!) people in the Canadian Debate circuit, make friends and bond with people in the club (I definitely have some core memories from tournaments), and get much, much better at debate in a short amount of time \u0026ndash; the perspective you from competing against the country\u0026rsquo;s best debaters is simply unmatched.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s how you can get involved!\nFinding partnerships \u0026ndash; Unless you already have a debate partner, feel free to ask around in the club - you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised at the number of people who would go to a tournament \u0026ldquo;if they just had a partner\u0026rdquo;. If this is something you feel awkard doing, feel free to still fill out the tournament form \u0026ndash; in most cases, the exec team will be able to ask around and pair you up with someone else from the club who\u0026rsquo;d like to attend.\nBidding \u0026ndash; In the #tournament-info channel, we post a \u0026ldquo;bid form\u0026rdquo; for each tournament \u0026ndash; this is the form you need to fill in if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in going to a tournament. Except for super competitive tournaments like WUDC, we\u0026rsquo;re likely to be able to send you as part of the UW contingent so long as you fill in the form before the deadline.\nThe bid form helps the exec team guage tournament interest, and pair off debaters who signed up without partners. A couple of days after the bid forms are in, we\u0026rsquo;ll announce the final teams and judges who will make up our contingent for the tournament. You will then be added to a separate Discord channel consisting only of those travelling to the tournament.\nTravel and Billeting \u0026ndash; once the teams are in, it\u0026rsquo;s time to figure out how to get to the tournament. We usually travel together in very very long bus/train trips to and fro the city the tournament is in. One of the best things about debate tournaments is the concept of billeting \u0026ndash; which is when the hosting institution pairs you with someone from their club, and you crash at their place for the duration of the tournament. This is great for two reasons \u0026ndash; you get to make new friends in the debate circuit, and don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for expensive hotels or Airbnbs to attend tournaments.\nFunding and Expenditure \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;re able to completely subsidize team registration costs - which usually cost around 150-200 CAD! We usually pay travel costs out of pocket, but there is a small chance we may be able to re-imburse you for them depending on the tournament (this is NOT something you should bank on).\nRegardless, the best way to get an introduction to how this looks is to watch our McGill Central Novs 2023 vlog: Organising Waterloo Tournaments We host two external tournaments throughout the year - Seagram\u0026rsquo;s IV in the winter, Waterloo HST in the spring. We also organize internal tournaments (e.g. Celestial Cup 2023 in honour of our alumni Celeste Laube). Opportunities to get involved in the organising committees for these events include being a Tournament Director (TD), Chief Adjudicator (CA), Equity Officer, or a Tab Director. In the case of Seagrams and internal tournaments, you could always debate if you\u0026rsquo;re still a novice, or just show up for the weekend be a judge!\nApplications for these roles open up a couple of months before the tournament date, but do make sure to reach out to a member of the exec team at any point if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nExec Roles and Elections At the end of each term, we host elections to vote on the exec team for the upcoming term. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in applying for an exec role, look out for the Exec Apps post in the #exec-info channel on our Discord! Below is a list of roles you could apply for \u0026ndash; do note that some of these (such as Equity Officer or VP Finance) do require some specialised training.\nRoles and Descriptions President: The President is are in charge of making sure all other parts of the club and members of the exec team are working together and running smoothly. They are in charge of club operations and the overall rebrand of the club. The President follows up with their exec members on duties for the week, whether it be regular meetings or special events. Not only does the President run a schedule of everything for the term but they are also the main contact for outside connections. The President is in charge of building relationships internally within the UW community and externally within other debate/public speaking communities.\nVP Internal: The VP internal is responsible for creating lessons along with managing communications internally in the club (with members, CUSID and WUSA) about important decisions the club is deciding to make about training, tournament participation and competing.\nVP Training (Novice): VP Training Novice will be responsible for helping VP Internal to communicate material and lesson content to novice debaters.\nVP Training (Open): VP Training Open will be responsible for helping VP Internal to communicate material and lesson content to open (non-novice) debaters.\nVP Finance: VP Finance is responsible for managing our budgets and communicating with WUSA on cheque request forms and guest payment forms.\nVP Events Coordinator: The VP Events Coordinator is responsible for making event proposals, booking and coordinating (digital) spaces and dates for events/workshops, and coordinating with social media/membership about advertising and marketing of said events.\nNovice Rep: The Novice rep is responsible for being the bridge between the new members, novices and the exec team, to communicate and concerns and answer any questions.\nVP Marketing: The VP Marketing is in charge of keeping all social media (Instagram and Facebook) updated each week as well as responding to any inbox messages the club may get on any of our social platforms. They will coordinate with the other clubs, general members and exec team.\nEquity Officer: The Equity Officer (previously VP External) is responsible for making sure the club is a safe space, and will work to resolve any conflicts, issues or equity complaints.\n","date":"February 11 2024","permalink":"/resources/get-involved/","section":"Resources","summary":"UW Debate information on meetings, the exec team, and competing at/organizing tournaments","title":"How To Get Involved"},{"content":" Previous Nextsads What is the University of Waterloo Debate Society (aka UW Debate)?
